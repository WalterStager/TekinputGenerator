# TekinputGenerator
Input Generator for content creators.
Easily stitch up combos that you can use in your videos in high quality!
Editable to use your own images as well. More information of how to use the program below!

I am a fighting game noob so I can't remember combos without nice visuals. That means I know very few character specific combo items and I could really use suggestions for features. Feel free to open a github issue or pull-request.

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>

Launch the Executable file, press on the relevant combos you want to make and click GENERATE. If you make a mistake, ERASE will remove the last note while CLEAR will remove everything.

The input images can be found in images/<game_name>-inputs.
The output images can be found in images/<game_name>-output.
If you want to add inputs for games or specific characters add the image files to the folder and edit data.json

<h3>Image recommendations</h3>

1. Keep image sizes consistent, especially image height
2. PNG files are the only images I have tested with

<h3>Common Problems & Solutions</h3>

1. I can't seem to generate a file
	* Check if the output folder for the game exists (and is named correctly). If there isn't create one and try again.
